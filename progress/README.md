# Progress Tracking

This directory contains monthly progress tracking files for your training plan. Each file helps you monitor:

1. **Daily Weight**: Track your weight measurements and maintain your target weight
2. **Run Streak**: Monitor your daily running consistency
3. **Active Recovery**: Log your recovery activities and stretching
4. **Monthly Stats**: View aggregated statistics for running, weight, and recovery

## File Structure
- Each month has its own markdown file (e.g., `january_2025_progress.md`)
- Files include tables for daily tracking and monthly statistics
- Progress is tracked through checkboxes and data tables

## How to Use
1. Update the daily weight log with your morning weigh-in
2. Mark completed runs in the run streak table
3. Log your recovery activities
4. Monthly stats will help you see trends and progress

## Tips
- Be consistent with morning weigh-ins for accurate tracking
- Add notes for any significant changes or observations
- Update the monthly stats section at the end of each week
